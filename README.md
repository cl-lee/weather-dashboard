### Application usage
- #### Saving and viewing a task/event
    Users can enter task or event item(s) in a timeblock's text box. They can then click on the save button to store the item(s) on their machines. Once saved, the item(s) will remain in the timeblock after restarting the application web page.  

- #### The past, current and future hours
    The timeblocks' textbox features a colour-code function based on the current time. Timeblocks with hours gone by will have their textboxes highlighted in grey, the current hour in red, and future hours in green.
